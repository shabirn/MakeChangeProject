  -The importance of being aware of rounding errors when type casting.
  
  -More than likely any adversity I face in my Java adventure has been faced and overcome by others.  Solutions and strategies 
  are available if I learn my search terms and correct terminology,
  
  -I learned that it's not a good Idea to be in a car during class hours while setting up for a homework assignment.   
  I learned its easy to over extended myself while over estimated my abilities.   To be humble and and honest
  with the staff, rather than trying to be sneaky,  I should be utilizing the instructors to enhance my learning and have a cooperative approach. 
  Instead of an adversarial mindset.
